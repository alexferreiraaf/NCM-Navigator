# **App Name**: NCM Navigator

## Core Features:

- Intelligent Product Search: Users input a product name, and AI finds the most probable NCM and provides a brief description, with a 3-second timeout.
- AI-Powered NCM Details: Provides a more detailed and comprehensive description, context, and examples.
- Navigation by Chapters: The navigation section organizes all 99 chapters of NCMs in an accordion system, allowing easy expansion and collapsing of sections.
- Quick Copy: A button next to each NCM allows the user to copy the code (without periods) to the clipboard for easy use.
- Timeout indicator: Show a message in the UI to explain that Gemini did not return results within 3 seconds.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#6366F1) to signify intelligence and insight.  In HSL, this hue suggests wisdom.
- Background color: Dark gray (#1F2937), provides a professional and modern backdrop, also allowing content to 'pop'.
- Accent color: Blue (#3B82F6) for interactive elements and highlights, drawing user attention and providing visual clarity.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, gives a machined, objective, neutral appearance appropriate for displaying large tables.
- Minimalist icons to represent different NCM chapters and functions.
- Responsive design using flexbox and spacing classes (p-4, md:p-8) to ensure legibility and easy navigation on all devices.
- Smooth hover effects and color transitions (transition-colors duration-300) for interactive elements to enhance user experience.
